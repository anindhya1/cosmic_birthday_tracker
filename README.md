# Cosmic Birthday Tracker

This app helps you discover and celebrate your **true cosmic birthday** â€” the moment when Earth returns to the same position in its orbit as when you were born.

## Features

- Input your birth date, time, and timezone
- Calculate your next cosmic birthday
- Detect if your last one just passed (within 30 days)
- Visualize Earth's orbit with:
  - 2D matplotlib plot
  - 3D CGI-style orbit (Plotly)
- Show distances in both AU and miles
